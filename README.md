# SoulsCalculator

## General Idea
Create a calculator that get your Dark Souls information and calculate how much souls memory you have, how much souls you need to acquire to the next level (or a certain amount of levels), what key items you can buy with the souls you have, how many type of X enemy you need to farm to get a certain amount of souls.
In Summary, just a bunch of random ideas that I got.

## Why I am Doing This?
Because I want to learn Python and creating a normal calculator is boring. So I decided to go with the stupid route. **HELL YHEA!**

## Future Ideas (if I have time for that)
- Create an actual integration with Souls Save File. The user only input the save file path and the program read the important info and import to the calculator
- Create a module to keep track of achievement items (like spells, miracles and more) and if the user have enough souls to buy them
- Create a module to keep track of Boss Souls and what the user can do with them
- Buy Sekiro and play that game
